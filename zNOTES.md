# To Do

- **! FIX fast refresh issues:**
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file.
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.

- Fix not showing up and down arrows on numTeams and numPlayers inputs on phone / tablet.
