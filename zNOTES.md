# To Do

- **! FIX fast refresh issues:**
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file.
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.

- Go through entire app with fine-toothed comb, choosing most slick colour scheme and visual design for dark theme

- Refactor \_\_root.jsx focusing on separation of concerns

- Refactor larger component files, especially those which are 150+ lines
