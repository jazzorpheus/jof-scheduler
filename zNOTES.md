# To Do

- **! FIX fast refresh issues:**
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file.
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.

- **Fix unlimited number of teams when inputting number manually**

- **Get rid of add teamPlayer buttons and just use editable li's !**
