# To Do

- [ ] Make light theme cancel button lighter

- [ ] Make navbar fixed instead of Select Availability banner

- [ ] Make margin-bottom thicker on navbar links

- [ ] Ensure clicking "off" navbar dropdown menu collapses it

- [ ] Make screen width cutoff point for changing landing page links into column wider! (Looks wrong on tablet in portrait.)

- [ ] Set up mock API in frontend for testing form/event schema and GETing/POSTing data.

- [ ] Refactor \_\_root.jsx focusing on separation of concerns

- [ ] Refactor larger component files, especially those which are 150+ lines

- [ ] Discuss "Plan Match" view, decide main features etc.

- [ ] **! FIX fast refresh issues:**
  - [ ] Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file.
  - [ ] Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.
