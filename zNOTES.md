# To Do

- **! FIX fast refresh issues:**
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your React context(s) to a separate file.
  - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.

- **! BUG** Collapsing daycard when scrolled to near bottom of page causes massive white flash at bottom :S

- Improve dark color scheme on SelectAvailabilityPage.
  - Make sure hover is not white on (i) button on timeslot cells
  - Darken hover effect on time window checkbox menu items
  - Add suble hover effect to timeslot cells
  -

- No. of teams / players make change happen after pressing Enter!

- Make lightsaber slots darker on dark and lighter on light theme.

- Re-do light styling on Select Availability page AND Create New Event page!

- Polish up dark styling on Select Availability page
  - Ignited saber time and icon colors

- Experiment: Similar to jofhub, have navbar links blue, but instead have white underline when hovered, and turn white when active/focused?

- Modal dark styling, jof-blue-dark background, jof-blue-med roster background, white text (light blue on event name under datetime), gradient on select slot button with white border as on create event form. Need a dark-themed cancel slot button.

- Go through entire app with fine-toothed comb, choosing most slick colour scheme and visual design for dark theme

- Refactor \_\_root.jsx focusing on separation of concerns

- Refactor larger component files, especially those which are 150+ lines
